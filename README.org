* Summary

This repo is a collection of images that I have come across and thought would make good desktop/mobile wallpapers


** Sections

+ Dracula (Not the vampire, the color scheme)
+ GNU + Linux (Will have Tux or the GNU in the wallpaper)
+ Gruv (Gruvbox wallpapers)
+ Nature (Trees and stuff that we see outside... What is outside again?)
+ Nord (Nord color scheme wallpapers)
+ Other (Just random wallpapers that don't into a category)
+ Programming (Will have 1's and 0's or a programming language)
+ Space (The outer realm that we have still yet to explore/space like things)




/I do not own any of these images/


*** I do my best to organize them

I will keep these updated as I find new wallpapers.
Hope you can find something you like :)
